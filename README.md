# My first Angular project

I'm trying to widen my knowledge and I thought learning Angular is inevitable. 

So because of this I have created my very first beginner Angular project. It is based on an Angular online course, but it has some parts which were my ideas or solutions.

It's very simple, but I'm not finished with it yet, I'm still planning to learn more about routing and reactive forms.
But I an say for sure: React will always be my priority.
